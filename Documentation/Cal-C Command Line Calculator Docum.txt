Cal-C: Command Line Calculator Documentation
Introduction
Cal-C is a simple command-line calculator developed in C++. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on mathematical expressions. The calculator processes expressions in any order and follows the DMAS priority (Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction) for evaluation.

Features
Expression Processing: Accepts user input and processes it into a valid mathematical expression, ignoring whitespaces.
Dynamic Evaluation: Performs arithmetic operations on the expression, considering the DMAS priority, until the final result is obtained.
User-Friendly: Provides a user interface with prompts for input and an option to continue or exit.
Error Handling: Checks for the presence of operators in the expression and handles invalid syntax gracefully.
Code Structure
Global Variables
Exp: Holds the current mathematical expression.
result: Stores the result of arithmetic operations.
length1 and length2: Unused global variables.
Functions
input

Purpose: Takes user input and processes it into a valid mathematical expression.
Input: None
Output: Returns the processed expression.
HasOP

Purpose: Checks if the expression contains any basic arithmetic operators.
Input: Reference to the expression (Exp)
Output: Returns true if operators are present, otherwise false.
isDecimal

Purpose: Checks if a character is a digit or a decimal point.
Input: Character (c)
Output: Returns true if the character is a digit or a decimal point, otherwise false.
update

Purpose: Updates the expression by replacing a substring with a new result.
Input: Starting index, length, and the new result.
Output: None.
performOP

Purpose: Performs a specified arithmetic operation on the expression.
Input: Expression (Exp), Operator (OP)
Output: None.
evaluation

Purpose: Iteratively performs arithmetic operations on the expression following DMAS priority.
Input: Reference to the expression (Exp)
Output: None.
main

Purpose: The main program execution.
Workflow:
Welcomes the user and explains the calculator's functionality.
Enters a loop to allow multiple calculations.
Calls input to get the expression and checks for the presence of operators.
If operators are present, calls evaluation to perform calculations and displays the result.
Handles user choice to continue or exit.
Usage
Run the program.
Enter a mathematical expression when prompted.
The calculator processes the expression and performs calculations.
The result is displayed, and the user is prompted to continue or exit.
